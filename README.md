# MovieRecommender

This is a twitter bot that recommends movies! This was my first decently big solo DS project and thus is clunky, hodge-podge, and reflects my learning as I went.

Over the past few months I have tried to clean things up a bit to be more in line with some best practices, but it still is pretty messy. 

All movie data was scraped from **TMDb**. The `scraping.R` script is run every Wednesday to get new data. All streaming data comes from https://reelgood.com and is run once a week to get up to data streaming info.
